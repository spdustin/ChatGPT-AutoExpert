# Behind the scenes

Let's see what `SYSTEM` messages are used behind the scenes at ChatGPT, and how they might influence custom instructions. They have been especially useful for me as I work on the [ChatGPT AutoExpert](README.md) custom instructions and supporting package (in the case of the Developer Edition).

> [!NOTE]
> I have added whitespace to some prompts to improve readability/formatting (but only where it wouldn't change how ChatGPT would attend to the prompt). 
>
> I also updated this page to separate each prompt into their own Markdown file.
